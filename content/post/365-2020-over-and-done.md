It's finally over; not just 2020 as a whole, but the take a picture a day part of life as well. It was certainly an experience, one I'm glad that I completed and one I never want to even attempt again. Well, at least for a few years.

Overall, taking 364 pictures (missed 2 days and it was a leap year) led to some interesting and fun results but also resulted in a lot of just shutter-pushing-move-on-get-it-out-of-the-way. The better photos were weighted toward the beginning of the year, in part due to having more energy and excitement but also because as COVID dragged on, it just felt like a lot of the same (both in picture taking and outside of that).

Some general thoughts looking back, in a jumbled straight-from-my-mind order:

\- The project was far too broad. It was nice to have a goal, but overall it lacked focus other than "take a picture". There was no improvement, no fun, no projects. Going in, I thought I'd be able to make projects out of it but it ended up shying away because you would "waste" a day or two thinking, then a bunch of pictures on a day, but only one of those would actually count and it would reset the next day! In a way, a picture a day seemed to punish extra effort, not reward it.

\- Editing took a big hit, mostly just using presets or a very simple quick button press. The pictures were (usually) less than inspiring, and that translated to the editing as well. Some time was spent on the best, but overall, maybe 5% (and that's generous) had thought put into the editing.

\- The [previous attempt at a 365 project](https://www.flickr.com/photos/drakenya/albums/72157647378777863) resulted in a lot of black & white conversions as time went on. This time, as an 'informal' rule to myself, I decided to do color only. This was helpful in not having an easy out, but at the same time I noticed a number that would have benefited from a black & white scheme. This was a bit of a draw, overall.

\- COVID interrupted a lot. Being able to go outside, visit others, even just being at work and having a different viewpoint and streets to walk helped the previous time whereas this time everything was centered around home. I guess this could have been one of those "learn to be more creative" lessons, but as I went in not considering that I never achieved that mindset on the project and as summer waned everything just felt like random pictures around the house.- It would be fun to try again, but in a different format. Broken into chunks (30 days of self-portraits, 10 days of the color red, 14 days walking the dog) would be much more manageable. There would be some variety, some change of focus, but still a bit of looking at something benign and finding something worth a photo.

Feel free to peruse the pictures below. Some are missing due to a combination of just utterly did not turn out, a memory card went wonky at one point, and some were requested not to be shared by some in the pictures.
