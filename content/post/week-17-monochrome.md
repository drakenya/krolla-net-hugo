While you may be familiar with monochrome referring to black and white, it actually refers to anything which uses solely one color value. Those images you see where there is overwhelmingly one color present are monochrome, for all intents and purposes. We see this technique often in those hazy sunrise/set shots, but it is also a very impactful technique for street shots.

[For more information and examples of monochrome, see this blog post on color theory.](https://www.clondon.me/blog/introcolor)

One of those you just look up, see it, and know it's the one you want to use for the prompt and ends up working pretty well. Well, other than the lines not being quite right on it (racing against time while also dodging cars may have led to less than perfect framing).
