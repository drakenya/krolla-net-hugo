[Maria Svarbova’s](https://www.mariasvarbova.com/) images are uniquely her own with her clever usage of color and setting. She often uses the Soviet-era architecture which can be found in and around her home country of Slovakia. Her thoughtful use of color is what really makes her images stand out from other somewhat surrealist portraiture.

For this week, I’d like you to user Maria’s work as an inspiration point for your own image. Whether you feel inspired by her use of color, subject, or setting is up to you.

Had the original idea of something based along the [Swimming Pool](https://www.mariasvarbova.com/swimmingpool-gnkl) series. Sadly, my plan to have some fun with a pool didn't' work as I had no access to a pool.

Instead, we improvised. Our stand-in model, Addie, was reluctant but decided a few treats were worth it. In the end, it basically had all the necessary elements: fairly good color scheme, water,r random plant, disinterested subject, old-timey bathing costume, and a splash of red color.

I feel it's virtually identical to one of hers ... ish, more or less. Oh, close enough at least.
