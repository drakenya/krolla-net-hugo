+++
As you may have guessed, Low Key photography is the opposite of last weekâ€™s prompt. In low key images, the tones are darker and shadows are more present overall. Low key photos may read mysterious, graphic, etc. For this week, manipulate the scene to create a low key photograph.

For the past two weeks, it's been nothing but sub-freezing temperatures here. The result, other than having no desire to go outside very much, is that ice is forming everywhere. The rain chain hanging off the back porch has ice running from top to bottom in a way that makes you wonder how it doesn't pull itself down from the weight. No matter, it makes for wonderful viewing.
