Colors which sit next to each other on the color wheel and share similar colors are known as analogous colors: reds with oranges, purples with blues, greens with yellows, and so on. For this week, Iâ€™d like you to make a photo where the most dominate colors are analogous to one another.

[For more information and examples of analogous colors, see this blog post on color theory.](https://www.clondon.me/blog/introcolor)
