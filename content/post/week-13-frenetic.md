Less frenetic in a macro sense, but instead frenetic in a micro sense with lots of small things happening together. Tearing down a shutter, cleaning, lubricating, lens disassembly and cleaning as well. Plus, you know, that small factor of it may actually go together again; or, then again, maybe not. Frenetic indeed.
