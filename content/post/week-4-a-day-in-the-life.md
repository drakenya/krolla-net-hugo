This is one of my all-time favorite exercises, but the first time I’m including it in the prompts. It’s a bit involved, so stay with me. Choose one day this week where you will document the entire day - from the moment you wake up, to the moment you go to sleep. Aim to take at least one photo every hour. At the end, cull it down to no more than 10 photos which tell the story of your day. Then, choose just one hero photo which sums it up in its entirety.

This was a fun one to do, even if the end results were more mundane than anything. Then again, I guess that's what a day in the life is, especially with not going anywhere other than to walk the dog.

I'd love to do this again, maybe once a quarter or so, to see how life changes over the months and over the years. Might try it on a vacation or trip sometimes, but I think it means more to me as an everyday kinda thing.

Below is the one picture that 'defines' the day; Addie, dopey tongue out, being assaulted by her toys. Definitely describes life around here on many levels. At the end are the 10 that define the day, as well as the list of pictures for the day (thought not all made it to display).
