Flat light creates images with very little contrast. Often we are told to avoid flat lighting in our images, but there is a time and place for everything. Forcing yourself to make an interesting photo with disinteresting light will be a challenge and a learning experience. Focus on other elements like composition, subject, story, etc.

Apparently, trees don't know flat light makes everything look uninteresting and boring.
