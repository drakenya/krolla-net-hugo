> Similar to last week, we’re going to explore a space which is maybe overlooked on any given day. Choose a room in your home and try and show its personality in one photo. This doesn’t need to be a sweeping wide-angle view of the entire space - maybe it’s one corner of the space that sums it up entirely. Want to play this one on hard mode? Choose a less-lived in space, something like the bathroom or kitchen, where maybe there are fewer bits of decoration.

My space in the house; well, one of them at least. Though do need to re-look at my output settings, since I did notice it's not quite where I want it to be.

And just for reference, here's the same thing but with non-safelight lighting.
