> We’re going to start by re-calibrating a bit. Whether you just finished out the 2020 prompts with me, or you’re jumping in for the first time, it’s beneficial to begin with a clear mind. So, for this week, I’d like you to choose an every day object - something you see regularly, but maybe don’t put a lot of thought into. Take that object and photograph it in a way which showcases its unseen importance. You can go as far as to stage it entirely, or just take a photo of it in its natural habitat. The main goal here is to look at it with fresh eyes.

This was a bit of a mess of a week. Tried three concepts, the end result was this and it still wasn't amazing; by that time, decided to just let it go instead of trying a fourth attempt. On the other hand, it is me. The 'singular' object is a model mine, coming in three pieces that are on a long-term hiatus until their installation place can be completed.

And just for reference, these are some of the ones that I tried but just never quite felt there with.
