> In the next year we will challenge ourselves as photographers and artists. Setting goals is the first step in that journey. Right now in this moment think about what youâ€™d like to achieve. Are you hoping to get better at portraits? Maybe you want to be able to document your travels more coherently? Maybe you just want to give yourself a new hobby and artistic outlet.

> For our first week, set a goal and make a photograph which shares and documents that goal. We will revisit this midway through and at the end of the year.

Goals for this year are more a hodgepodge of things, instead of one defined, specific goal.

Overall, though:

* Improve when using flash / artificial lighting, actually understanding what is going on vs. just hitting shutter, looking at result, and adjusting on the fly.
* Dive back into film & wet plate, with the end-game of flash photography when shooting film. This will start to ramp up as spring approaches, as the darkroom resides in the basement and it's a bit on the chilly side right now to be doing much and minor renovations to it should completed by then.
* Think more about photography. Tried a 365 project last year and while I was extremely happy I finished it (and turned out some nice results for some days), it just became a slog. So, slow down, think about the shot, put some meaning into it, and if something just isn't happening say "oh well", walk away, and try again another week. Or just shoot for fun some weeks, not beholden to a challenge but enjoying it instead.
* Get more involved with others, not just a silent participant. Post a bit more, interact a bit more, talk to others (photographers or not) a bit more. Just something to have a bit more "not me" in my photography.
