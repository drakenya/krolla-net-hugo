Now I know not everyone has studio lights or even an on camera flash. But guess what, artificial light is any light that isn’t natural. That could be your desk lamp, the neons of your local bodega, street lights, anything that isn’t that fiery ball of gas in the sky. For this challenge I’d like you to focus on artificial light you can have some control over, however.

I had grand ideas for this one, breaking out some new light stands and tulip softboxes and having a portrait session. However, got distracted late at night and just wanted to play around, ended up just grabbing Darth (we're on a first name basis) and having him pose. Went well, but had to play around a lot to get over his dark personality. Also, he's much shorter in person.
