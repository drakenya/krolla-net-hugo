Strong shadows can create very graphic and strong images. For this week, Iâ€™d like you to find harsh shadows created by natural light, and compose an image around that. You may manipulate the scene in any way available to you to create the image you have in mind, but try and use found natural light if possible.

Harsh shadow (singular), at least. The light coming in the door late into the afternoon just casts that long shadow, something so simple but also dramatic.

For an about an hour for a few weeks, the sun hits the living room just right to cast some wonderful shadows in the evening. Or, in this case, just one shadow.
