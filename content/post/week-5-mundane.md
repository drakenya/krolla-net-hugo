For this, tried to take something mundane and show it in a different light (ha, get it ... moving on). The flower sits in the bathroom, nothing special but just there to make things a little less bland. Got out the new snoot and just had some fun making it a more dramatic object, something out of the ordinary. In contact, it was taken mid-day in flat in-home lighting so I'd say it moved from the mundane to something less so.
