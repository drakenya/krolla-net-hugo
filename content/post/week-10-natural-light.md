Controlling natural light can be daunting as it is at first thought, well, uncontrollable. But, spoilers! You can control natural light. Find open shade, use a reflector/poster board, create shadows with your own hand. The possibilities are as boundless as your creativity.

This took a bit of an unexpected turn this week, especially since other projects are competing for interest and time. Instead of trying to control the light itself, I controlled the setting around the light. Knew where the light would be, looked for a non-cloudy day at the time of day I wanted, that sort of thing. So taking a bit of this, bit of that, and a bit of fun and interpretation.
